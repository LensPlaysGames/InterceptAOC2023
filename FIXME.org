* Day 1
** Don't try to return top level declarations, no matter what
** Allow optional commas again for another way to group expressions without parens
** Expose __c_int and friends
** Add true and false
** Fucking bit-shifting sucks because it has to be in ecx
** Fucking division sucks because result is always in rdx:rax or whatever
** There isn't logical &&, ||, etc. Big problem! Can't even fake with comparisons without true and false, lol
