* Intercept Advent of Code

My stupid hobby language Intercept still can barely function, so I'm forcing myself to make it make sense by actually using the fucker.

I will not be doing all 25 days.

I will not be doing any of the days on time.

Requires a working C compiler, CMake, and [[https://github.com/LensPlaysGames/LensorCompilerCollection][LCC (Lensor Compiler Collection)]].
